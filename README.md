# DevNet - HackHarvard 2019
The main goal of this application is to connect developers within a local space so that they could collaborate on projects.
For instance, if a developer wishes to collaborate on a project using ASP.NET Core, they can use the app to find other developers
who might be interested in creating something awesome. We wanted to bridge the gap between GitHub and LinkedIn to create a social network 
for developers around a certain area. 

## Other Use Cases
This app was my side project for HackWesTX. I wanted to promote this app to allow students to help find groups at hackathons easily.
